    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>his dessert features a cakey exterior that houses a decadent center of flowing, warm dark chocolate.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips, or bars, cut into bite-size chunks</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>Â½ cup sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons flour</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>raspberries or any other garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter and chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water; remove from heat. Beat eggs, sugar, and salt with a hand mixer in a medium bowl until sugar dissolves. Beat egg mixture into chocolate until smooth. Beat in flour until just combined. (Batter can be made a day ahead; return to room temperature an hour or so before baking.)</li>
        <li>Adjust the oven rack to the middle position; preheat the oven to 450 degrees (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Line a standard-size muffin tin (1/2 cup capacity) with 8 extra-large muffin papers (papers should extend above cups to facilitate removal). Spray muffin papers with cooking spray. Divide batter among muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake until batter puffs but the center is not set, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully lift cakes from the tin and set on a work surface. Pull papers away from cakes and transfer cakes to dessert plates.</li>
        <li>Make garnish: Roll slightly dampened raspberries or preferred garnish in sugar.</li>
        <li>Top each cake with sugared raspberries and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
